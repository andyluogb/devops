In Apache Camel version 3.x, the configuration approach is a bit different compared to earlier versions. Camel 3.x introduced a simplified and unified configuration model. Below is an example of configuring LDAP settings using Camel 3.x with Spring Boot and YAML:
camel:
  component:
    ldap:
      configuration:
        baseEnvironmentProperties:
          java.naming.factory.initial: com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory
          java.naming.provider.url: ldap://your-ldap-server:389
          java.naming.security.authentication: simple
          java.naming.security.principal: your-username
          java.naming.security.credentials: your-password

# Camel route configuration
camel:
  routes:
    - id: ldap-route
      from: direct:start
      to: ldap:ldap://your-ldap-server:389?base=ou=users,dc=example,dc=com&filter=(uid=jdoe)
      to: log:output

In this YAML configuration:

The LDAP configuration is specified under camel.component.ldap.configuration.
The Camel route is defined under camel.routes.
Make sure to replace the placeholder values (your-ldap-server, ou=users,dc=example,dc=com, etc.) with your actual LDAP server configuration.

In your Spring Boot application class, you can have the same structure as mentioned in the previous response:

camel:
  component:
    ldap:
      configuration:
        url: ldap://your-ldap-server:389
        base: ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
        securityAuthentication: simple
        securityPrincipal: your-username
        securityCredentials: your-password

# Camel route configuration
camel:
  routes:
    - id: ldap-route
      from: direct:start
      to: ldap:configuration
      to: log:output

In this YAML configuration:

The LDAP configuration is specified under camel.component.ldap.configuration. Adjust the properties based on your LDAP server settings.
The Camel route is defined with a from endpoint (direct:start) and a to endpoint (ldap:configuration). The configuration value corresponds to the camel.component.ldap.configuration configuration.
Make sure to replace the placeholder values (your-ldap-server, ou=users,dc=example,dc=com, etc.) with your actual LDAP server configuration.

When using Camel 3.x with Spring Boot, this configuration will be picked up automatically from application.yml or application.properties. Ensure that your project has the necessary dependencies in the pom.xml file, including Camel 3.x, Spring Boot, and any other required libraries.

Adjust the YAML configuration and Camel route based on your specific LDAP requirements and the structure of your Camel application.



User
<bean id="ldapserver" class="javax.naming.directory.InitialDirContext" scope="prototype">
  <constructor-arg>
    <props>
      <prop key="java.naming.factory.initial">com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory</prop>
      <prop key="java.naming.provider.url">ldap://localhost:10389</prop>
      <prop key="java.naming.security.authentication">none</prop>
    </props>
  </constructor-arg>
</bean>

ldapserver:
  class: javax.naming.directory.InitialDirContext
  scope: prototype
  constructor-arg:
    props:
      java.naming.factory.initial: com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory
      java.naming.provider.url: ldap://localhost:10389
      java.naming.security.authentication: none


In YAML:

bean id becomes the top-level key (ldapserver).
class, scope, and constructor-arg are used as keys under ldapserver.
Properties inside <props> in XML are represented as a nested mapping under props in YAML. Each prop key-value pair is preserved.
You can integrate this YAML configuration into your Spring context as needed. Adjust it according to the specific requirements and structure of your application.
